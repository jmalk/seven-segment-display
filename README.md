# README

A seven segment display kata with evolving requirements.

## Run

`node index.js`

## Test

`node all-tests.test.js`

## Churn between each set of requirements:

- Part One: https://github.com/jmalk/seven-segment-display/tree/v1.0
- Part One to Two: https://github.com/jmalk/seven-segment-display/compare/v1.0...v2.0

## Notes

### Part One: IO

Requirements: An command-line arg of a string of digits should result in logging out a string with seven-segment numbers. e.g.

```
> node index.js 123
    _  _
  | _| _|
  ||_  _|
```

Spent a while chasing things round until I settled on where my tests were going to sit. (After collecting input, but around all conversion).

Divided into:

- Collect input
- Check input is valid
- Do conversion
  - Get characters from a dictionary, including line-height as an explicit value on the object.
    - Dictionary of characters.
  - Pass those characters into a function to collect the top row, then the middle, then the bottom, and group them together appropriately with newlines.
- Output result of conversion

### Part Two: Clock

Requirements: Instead of taking a number as an argument make it render the current time and get it to update at least every second.

- Donâ€™t let the console fill up, have it update in place by clearing it
- Format hh:mm:ss (yes the colons need to be included.)

There's been lots of churn as I discover bits of part 1 that weren't actually working as intended. But overall, the separation of gather input, convert it, output it has survived reasonably well. Instead of gather input you now have a `setInterval` which grabs the current time every half second. It is made into a string by `function timeToString({hours: number, minutes: number, seconds: number}): string` so that formatting logic could easily be changed in isolation.

My main concern at the moment is that I'm generating too many files. E.g. left-pad could quite happily live inside time-to-string, since that's purely a formatting concern, not yet shared.
